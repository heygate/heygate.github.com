<p align="justify"><b>What happened to the residents?</b>
</br>
        Having been denied a ballot on the future of their homes, residents were told by the council that it simply didn't have the money to maintain the estate. Tenants were promised new homes as a consolation - either in the new Heygate development or in a number of so-called 'early housing' sites: the council had planned to work in partnership with housing associations to build 1,100 new <b>social rented</b> homes on 16 council-owned plots of land located around the Elephant & Castle, which would replace the 1,100 units to be lost on the Heygate. The idea was that the council would give away free plots of land to housing assocations, which would build new homes in a mix of private and affordable units - the affordable units being subsidised by the free land, and the sale of private units plus grant funding. The 16 'early housing' sites were laid out in a glossy <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf">rehousing information pack</a> issued to Heygate tenants in Autumn 2004, showing the sites in detail so that they could select which of the new homes they wanted to move into.
</br>
</br>
The foreword to the information pack included the following pledge from deputy leader Cllr Cathy Bowman: <i><b>"We have made sure that the construction of your new homes is the first thing that happens in this regeneration scheme."</i></b>
</br>
</br>

But many of the 16 council-owned sites earmarked for the replacement housing happened to be green spaces and play areas located on other housing estates in the area. This naturally met with fierce opposition from residents of those estates, and by 2007 not one of the early housing sites had been built or had even obtained planning permission. Nevertheless Heygate tenants had been engaged in selecting the architects for the replacement housing sites, and in assisting with the design of what were supposed to become their new homes. This <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/ChooseYourNewHome.pdf">Jan 2007 newsletter</a> invites residents to <i>"start thinking about the layout and decoration of your new home, for example if you would prefer an open layout or separate kitchen/diner."</i>
</br>
</br>
However, Following the selection of Lend Lease as the council's development partner later that year, there was a major <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/elephant-and-castle-regeneration-boss-quits/3097916.article">shake up</a> on the council's project team following the appointment of a development team led by Lend Lease; under which a new Strategic Director (Stephen McDonald) was brought in, whose first action was to order the immediate decanting of the estate's residents into existing council stock elsewhere in the borough. McDonald had a <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/HeygateActionPlan.pdf">report</a> drawn up called the 'Heygate Action Plan', which made various unsupported claims that <i>"the existing fabric of some parts of the estate have become unsustainable"</i> and required immediate evacuation <i>"because of significant concerns about maintaining community safety and the decaying infrastructure of the estate."</i> Under the consultation section of the report - where officers must usually show that decisions have been consulted upon - it states that there will be a <i>"a general process to communicate the change."</i>
Shortly after the 'Heygate Action Plan' was approved, Chris Horn - the council's former project director - handed in his resignation.  
</br>
<center>

</center>
<p align="justify">
</br>
The Action Plan stated that tenants would be moved into existing council stock elsewhere in the borough, and would then be able to move back once their replacement homes at the Elephant had been built. There was natually significant protest at the revised plans, and concern that there weren't a sufficient number of properties available in the council's existing stock. A severe lack of properties with disabled access meant that most tenants with special housing needs were left waiting the longest, with many being forced into unsuitable accommodation. In Sep 2010 a tenant who was an amputee <a href="img/SNSpiralStaircase2Sep2010.pdf">was offered</a> a property with a spiral staircase. Tenants <a href="/img/unsuitable_accommodation.pdf">were told</a> that if they didn't accept the homes they were being offered they could face a winter without heating and be moved into temporary accommodation on health & safety grounds. There was naturally much disquiet amongst residents, and the council's response to this was to offer <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/happiness.pdf">'Happiness Therapy'</a> from Robert Holden, one of the country's <a href="http://www.happiness.co.uk/">leading cognitive behavioural therapists</a>: <center>
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HlEszb_Ir58" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
<p align="justify">
However, the happiness therapy <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3164784/Stressed-council-tennants-get-2000-happiness-gurus.html">failed to allay</a> residents' concerns so they demanded a legal agreement be drawn up ensuring that they would be able to return to the new homes as promised. A <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/righttoreturn.pdf">'Right to Return'</a> document was drafted but with the caveat that it was only valid for 7 years up to 2015. A three year delay ensued before developer Lend Lease signed the final regeneration agreement, and we now know that only <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20061007">8 social rented homes</a> are due to have been completed on the first phase of development within the Heygate footprint by 2015, and only 45 Heygate tenants<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> have been rehoused in the so-called 'early housing sites' to date - everybody else remains in the existing council homes they were moved into when they were moved off the estate.

In June 2009 all remaining tenants left on the estate were offered <a href="img/guidedtour.png">guided tours</a> to help <b><i>'find out more about what different areas of the borough had to offer'</b></i>. 


</br>
<p align="justify">
Documents show that tenants who either failed to successfully bid on a property within 6 months or who rejected three offers of a replacement home were <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/PWCHeygaterehousingproject.pdf">systematically</a> subjected to eviction proceedings under the 1985 Landlord & Tenant Act. According to a <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/jonabbottCPOinquiry8Feb2013.pdf">document</a> tabled during the Feb 2013 Public Inquiry, a total of 198 households were issued with 'Notices to Seek Possession'. Many were <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,9308,440,00.htm">dissatisfied</a> with the process and because of the lack of council homes in the borough, many claim they were forced to move into unsuitable alternative accommodation. An <a href="img/Heygateweeklyhighlightreport.pdf">internal report</a> from Oct 2008 shows a total of 315 households bidding on just 35 available properties in the council's <a href="http://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk/Data/ASPPages/1/104.aspx">homesearch system</a>.</p> 
</br>
From a <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/analysis_of_displaced_heygate_re#incoming-394155">Freedom of Information request</a>, we now know that only around 1 in 5 Heygate secure tenants actually remain in the SE17 postcode (216 tenants out of 1034) - the remainder have been scattered across the four corners of the borough and beyond :

<p align="justify">
Leaseholders were <a href="img/HeygateLeaseholderPolicy2005.pdf">originally promised</a> a range of options assisting them to buy one of the new-build Heygate homes and those on the 16 'early housing' sites<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. But none of these options ever got written into the final agreement with developer Lend Lease or any of the housing associations developing the 'early housing' sites. When asked at the recent CPO public inquiry why leaseholders didn't get the new homes that they had been promised, the council's lead officer replied <b><i>"I don't know, I wasn't employed by the council at the time the promises were made. But the new homes will be open for anybody to purchase and I am sure Lend Lease will be happy to sell to anybody."</b></i>: </br>

</br>
Most leaseholders have subsequently been forced to relocate outside central London because of the low valuations offered in compensation for their homes. Any leaseholder wanting to return to the Heygate will have to compete with overseas buyers at market prices well beyond their means. New-build Heyate homes are currently being sold at prices starting from <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com">£330,000</a> for a studio flat. <a href="img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">Analysis of information received from FOI requests</a> shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders for their homes is as follows:</p>
<b>
<ul>
<li>1 Bed flat - £95,480</li>
<li>2 Bed flat - £107,230</li>
<li>3 Bed Maisonette - £156,833</li>
<li>4 Bed Maisonette - £177,421</li>

<p align="justify">
In a recent <a href="http://t.co/m4JMqGdwsZ">interview with Property Week magazine</a>, former Heygate leaseholder Terry Redpath said <i><b>"We could no longer afford to stay in the area: the compensation we received plus £45,000 of life savings bought us a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I feel that we have been forced to give up our home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</i></b>
</br>
<p align="justify">
Redpath is a former Southwark housing officer who lived on the estate for 35 years, and whose family has lived in the area for generations.
</br>
On average the compensation paid to leaseholders amounts to around a quarter of the price of the <a href="http://trafalgarplace.com/?page_id=29">new Heygate homes</a>, which are currently being marketed in <a href="http://www2.hkej.com/property/article/id/77797">China</a>, <a href="http://www.65house.com/news/20130412/2638.html">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/04/24/lend-lease-launches-trafalgar-place-development-in-london/">Malaysia</a> and <a href="http://colliersip.com/uk/trafalgar-place-london/">Hong Kong</a>.

<p align="justify">
The council did offer leaseholders the opportunity to apply for a council tenancy on surrendering their homes, but this was means-tested against household income and came with the caveat that they also needed to show that they owned less than 25% equity in their home in order to qualify. The sharp rise in house prices during recent years meant that there were very few who qualified.
</br>
</br>
The council couldn't evict leaseholders in the same way as it did the tenants. Those leaseholders who objected to the low valuations offered in compensation for their homes were able to exercise their right to remain until such time as the council obtained a Compulsory Purchase Order(CPO). This would give the council the right to evict them, after which they would be able to refer the valuation of their homes to the Lands Tribunal. Leaseholders welcomed this opportunity to have an independent tribunal determine the value of their homes rather than be dependent on the arbitrary whim of the council's surveyor. However, the council chose not to apply for the CPO and instead subjected the remaining leaseholders to a war of attrition: the council <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,19279,185,00.htm">shut down the district heating system</a> on the estate in Winter 09/10; rubbish collection and postal deliveries were stopped; estate lighting was cut off, cleaning schedules halted and the estate was withdrawn from the local community warden and police beats.   

It was February 2013 before the council had served the CPO and the case was to be heard before an inspector at a public inquiry. By this time just a handful of leaseholders had survived the war of attrition and were left to <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/06/19/regeneration-plans-branded-a-miserable-failure-at-cpo-inquiry/">table their objections</a>.
</br>
</br>
<img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/moji.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="300" style="margin: 10px; float: left">
Remaining resident Mojisola Ojeikere sums up the leaseholders' plight: <i><b>"It has been a long and weary struggle. The council are valuing my 2 bed flat at just £150,000 and have refused point blank to agree with my surveyor's valuation. We had originally hoped to wait and eventually refer the valuation to the Lands Tribunal in the hope that the law would prevail as an impartial third party adjudicator at the end of the day. But since the CPO hearing we have come to realise that we stand little chance against the council and Lend Lease who can afford to <a href="http://cornerstonebarristers.com/">hire top barristers</a>, whereas we can barely afford to instruct a normal solicitor to represent us. Then if we lose we will also be made to pay all of their legal costs. The inequality of it all is very frustrating.  
</br></i></b>
</br>
In October 2012 all four remaining leaseholders on the estate collectively contacted <a href="http://www.southwarkmediation.co.uk/">Southwark Mediation</a> an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution">Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) service</a> in an attempt to seek mediation rather than face CPO court proceedings. Southwark Mediation approached council officials in November 2012, but despite Govt CPO guidance<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> urging local authorities to explore Alternative Dispute Resolution techniques, Southwark <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/PmcgrealDec2012.pdf">rejected outright</a> the possibility of mediation.
