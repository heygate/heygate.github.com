        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Muggers' Paradise?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Despite Met Police statistics showing <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf">a crime rate</a> 45% below the borough average, the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/305/demolition_begins_on_heygate_estate">council claims</a> that the Heygate estate suffered from crime and antisocial behaviour. As a result of sloppy journalism and press statements issued by the council, the estate has been labelled as "Muggers' paradise" in numerous articles by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13092349">BBC</a>, the <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/makeover-of-muggers-paradise-heygate-estate-7445697.html">Evening Standard</a> and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2316072/Poignant-pictures-decaying-crime-ridden-housing-estate-fallen-ruin-remaining-residents-await-bulldozers.html">Daily Mail</a>. 

The estate has also been promoted by the council for use as a film backdrop for a large number of gang and violence-related movies like Michael Caine's "Harry Brown", who labelled the estate "a rotten place, not fit for animals". We think this is an insult to our former community and the hundreds of families who lived here happily for many years until we were forced from our homes to make way for the regeneration.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Beyond Repair? </h2>
        <p class="lead">The council's <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey.html">1998 Options Appraisal Study</a> declared the buildings structurally sound and made recommendations for refurbishing over half of the estate. Despite this, and despite <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">evidence</a> showing that maintenance costs were below average compared to the rest of the council's stock, and despite <a href="img/heygatedoubleglazing.png">double glazing having been installed</a> in many flats on the estate, Southwark <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://betterelephant.github.com/images/futureofheygate.pdf&chrome=true">told us</a> that we had to move out of our homes because it simply didn't have enough money to bring them up to the decent homes standard. In its <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/heygatecpo_statementofreasons.pdf">'Statement of Reasons'</a> produced for its 2012 Compulsory Purchase Order on the estate, the council acknowledges that the buildings are in good condition and claims the need for demolition because the estate constitutes <b><i>'unpopular social housing'</b></i>, which is <b><i>'out of place in a city fringe location'</b></i>. <a href="http://youtu.be/_F08Ty9x7lE">Elsewhere it claims</a> that demolition is necessary in order to <b><i>'unlock the economic potential of the site and help prosper from its location'</b></i>. However, recent <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Economic/">leaked documents</a> show that the council has spent over £65m in emptying the estate and progressing the redevelopment<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and that it has made a substantial loss on the sale of the Heygate site while developer Lend Lease is set to make at least £194 million profit. A <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">recent report</a> by global architect <a href="http://www.gensler.com">Gensler</a> showed that flats on the estate could have been refurbished and modernised for just £14,000 per unit.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Change for the Better?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
We were told that our homes were not envrionmentally efficient and that the council didn't have the money to upgrade them. They were going to be replaced by a 'zero carbon' development which would be supplied by a biomass 100% renewable energy centre. It was to be London's greenest regeneration scheme, and was selected by Bill Clinton to be one of 16 global examples of zero carbon growth in his <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/our-work/by-initiative/clinton-climate-initiative/programs/c40-cci-cities/climate-positive-development-program.html">Climate Positive Initiative</a>.
But the Heygate masterplan approved in January 2013 makes no commitment to any renewable energy at all, and plans to increase the number of parking spaces on the Heygate footprint from 244 to 616. Despite a high-profile campaign by local groups, and guarantees that 25% of trees would be retained, the final masterplan application<a href="img/TreeStrategyPG22.pdf"> contains a clause</a> deferring the retention of these trees subject to further more detailed testing of root spans. Indeed, the <a href="img/TreeStrategyPG9.pdf">masterplan goes on to propose</a> using the wood from the felled trees for creating furniture and art works!  
</br>
The development partners also <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/964/final_walkways_in_the_sky_at_heygate_estate_to_close">claim</a> that they will create the 'largest new park in London for over 70 years', but fail to mention that the overall amount of existing open green space will be reduced by 60%. The new park will also be <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years">privately managed</a> and permanently overshadowed by 30 storey buildings. </br>
Many people feel insulted at the clear disregard and contempt with which the development plans are being implemented.</br>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Where did the Residents go?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Promises made to residents at the beginning of the regeneration scheme have not been honoured. 
Tenants were promised new homes in the surrounding area which never got built. As consolation they were offered a 'right to return' to the new 'affordable' homes being built on the Heygate, but it now turns out that these are going to be let at twice the level of council rents. 

One third of all secure tenants on the estate were subjected to eviction proceedings during the 'decant', and only 1 in 5 remain living in the SE17 postcode.
</br>
Leaseholders were originally promised a range of options that would assist them to buy one of the new-build Heygate homes once construction had been completed. But none of these options ever got written into the final agreement with the developer Lend Lease.

The vast majority have now been forced to relocate to the outskirts of London with the low valuations offered in compensation for their homes. The average compensation received for a 1-bed flat on the estate was just £93,112 - a long way off the starting price of new-build Heygate homes currently starting at £330,000 for a studio flat.

<blockquote><p><i><b>"There should have been new homes built for residents before they moved. That didn't happen. But they've got the right to return. In reality though, few will come back to the social housing on the new site."</i></b></p><small><cite>Cllr.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Gentrification?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Gentrification is the displacement of people on lower incomes by those on higher incomes. This can be state-sponsored displacement, i.e. the Heygate redevelopment where low income families are forced out of the area and 1,100 social housing units are replaced by twice as many private homes. Or it can be secondary displacement where market forces displace local people as a result of rising rents as an area becomes more desirable. Large scale redevelopments such as the Heygate also result in many small businesses and independent retailers being forced out, as the nature of the development model requires chain stores and supermarkets to sign up to pre-letting agreements with developers. Far from creating a more mixed community, <a href="img/tenurechangeanalysis.pdf">documents</a> submitted at the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/06/19/regeneration-plans-branded-a-miserable-failure-at-cpo-inquiry/">Feb 2013 Heygate CPO Public Inquiry</a> show that when completed, the Elephant & Castle regeneration will have reduced the amount of social housing in the area to just 8%.</p>
