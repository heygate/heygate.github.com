          <h2>Setting the Record Straight</h2>
          <p class="lead"><b>This website has been created by former residents of the Heygate estate who are attempting to set the record straight. We are upset that we won't be getting the new homes we were promised, and upset about the way the estate is being portrayed as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13092349">"Muggers' Paradise"</a> and a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/simonheffer/8010830/Brilliant-architecture-can-rescue-even-Basingstoke.html">"Human Dustbin"</a> in the media. We are creating a series of short films involving former residents, which we hope will give a more accurate account of the estate and its regeneration. These will be published online here during summer 2013.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Muggers' Paradise?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Despite Met Police statistics showing <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf">a crime rate</a> 45% below the borough average, the <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/305/demolition_begins_on_heygate_estate">council claims</a> that the Heygate estate suffered from crime and antisocial behaviour. As a result of sloppy journalism and press statements issued by the council, the estate has been labelled as "Muggers' paradise" in numerous articles by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13092349">BBC</a>, the <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/makeover-of-muggers-paradise-heygate-estate-7445697.html">Evening Standard</a> and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2316072/Poignant-pictures-decaying-crime-ridden-housing-estate-fallen-ruin-remaining-residents-await-bulldozers.html">Daily Mail</a>. 

The estate has also been promoted by the council for use as a film backdrop for a large number of gang and violence-related movies like Michael Caine's "Harry Brown", who labelled the estate "a rotten place, not fit for animals". We think this is an insult to our former community and the hundreds of families who lived here peacefully for decades until we were forced from our homes to make way for the regeneration.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Beyond Repair? </h2>
        <p class="lead">Despite being <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey.html">declared structurally sound</a>, despite <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">evidence</a> showing that the estate's maintenance costs were below average compared to the rest of the council's stock, and despite <a href="img/heygatedoubleglazing.png">double glazing having been installed</a> in many flats on the estate, Southwark <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://betterelephant.github.com/images/futureofheygate.pdf&chrome=true">told us</a> that we had to move out of our homes because it simply didn't have enough money to bring them up to the decent homes standard. The council later claimed that demolition was necessary in order to unlock the economic potential of the site and help prosper from its location. However, recent <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Economic/">leaked documents</a> show that the council has spent over £44m in just emptying the estate, and will actually be making an overall loss on the sale of the Heygate site, while developer Lend Lease is set to make at least £194 million profit from its purchase. A <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">recent report</a> by global architect <a href="http://www.gensler.com">Gensler</a> showed that flats on the estate could have been refurbished and modernised for just £14,000 per unit.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Change for the Better?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
We were told that our homes were not envrionmentally efficient and that the council didn't have the money to upgrade them. They were going to be replaced by a 'zero carbon' development which would be supplied by a biomass 100% renewable energy centre. It was to be London's greenest regeneration scheme, and was selected by Bill Clinton to be one of 16 global examples of zero carbon growth in his <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/our-work/by-initiative/clinton-climate-initiative/programs/c40-cci-cities/climate-positive-development-program.html">Climate Positive Initiative</a>.
But the Heygate masterplan approved in January 2013 makes no commitment to any renewable energy at all, and plans to increase the number of parking spaces on the Heygate footprint from 244 to 616. Despite a high-profile campaign by local groups, and guarantees that 25% of trees would be retained, the final masterplan application<a href="img/TreeStrategyPG22.pdf"> contains a clause</a> deferring the retention of these trees subject to further more detailed testing of root spans. Indeed, the <a href="img/TreeStrategyPG9.pdf">masterplan goes on to propose</a> using the wood from the felled trees for creating furniture and art works!  
Many people feel insulted at the clear disregard and contempt with which the development plans are being implemented.</br>
Claims that the masterplan will create the 'largest park in London for over 70 years' are an insult to the intelligence of local people who know that Burgess park was opened just 50 years ago, and who can see that the new park is going to be a privately owned and <a href="http://www.35percent.org/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years">privately managed shopping parade</a> permanently overshadowed by 25 storey buildings.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Where did the Residents go?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Heygate residents were <a href="img/Appendix8.pdf">originally promised</a> new homes <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/futureofheygate.pdf">in the replacement development</a> and in a number of <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/new_homes_for_heygate.pdf">'early housing' developments</a> at the Elephant & Castle. Despite <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/stayputuntilreplacementsready.pdf">protests</a> that the early housing developments had not yet been built, a <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/HAPtenantsletter.pdf">decision</a> was taken by the council executive in June 2007 to bring forward the decant of the estate. Tenants were subsequently forced to rehouse themselves via the council's 'homesearch' bidding system for void council properties elsewhere in the borough. Eviction proceedings were <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/PWCHeygaterehousingproject.pdf">systematically</a> initiated against those residents who had failed to bid and accept a property within a period of six months. According to a <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/jonabbottCPOinquiry8Feb2013.pdf">document</a> tabled during the Feb 2013 Public Inquiry, a total of 198 households were issued with Notices to Seek Possession. Tenants were <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,9308,440,00.htm">highly dissatisfied</a> with the process, and many were forced to move into unsuitable alternative accommodation in distant corners of the borough. An <a href="img/Heygateweeklyhighlightreport.pdf">internal report</a> from Oct 2008 shows a total of 315 households bidding on just 35 available properties in the council's homesearch system. Protest was subdued by the promise of a 'right to return' to new homes built on the site once the first phase of development was completed. However, most of the new 'affordable' housing in the new development will be provided under the controversial new <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/05/social-rents-increases-break-up-communities">'affordable rent' tenure</a>, which is well beyond the means of most former residents, and the recently approved <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2013/05/26/peters-denial/">masterplan application proposes just 79</a> social rented units. </p>

In reality though, few will come back to the social housing on the new site."</i></b></p><small><cite>Cllr.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Gentrification?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Gentrification is the displacement of people on lower incomes by those on higher incomes. This can be state-sponsored forced displacement, i.e. the Heygate redevelopment where low income families are forced out of the area and 1,100 social housing units are replaced by twice as many private homes. Or it can be secondary displacement where market forces displace people as a result of a rise in the level of rents within an area. Large scale redevelopments such as the Heygate also result in many small businesses and independent retailers being forced out, as the nature of the development model requires chain stores and supermarkets to sign up to pre-letting agreements with developers. Far from creating a more mixed community, <a href="img/tenurechangeanalysis.pdf">documents</a> submitted at the <a href="img/CPOPressRelease.pdf">Feb 2013 Heygate CPO Public Inquiry</a> show that when completed, the Elephant & Castle regeneration will have reduced the amount of social housing in the area to just 8%.</p>
